# Snippets

This repo contains snippets that I want to remember and plan to use again.
There is a different file for each language/tool that I have snippets for and 
they will continue to grow over time. Anything sensitive has been redacted.

You are welcome to use any of these and refer to them in any way that you want.
However, there is no guarantee that they will work and there is no actual or implied 
warrany.
